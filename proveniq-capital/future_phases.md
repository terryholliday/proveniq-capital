# FUTURE PHASES — INACTIVE / NOT IMPLEMENTED

This document records concepts that may exist in the future.
They are explicitly **NOT ACTIVE** and **MUST NOT** be implemented without a phase unlock.

## Phase X — Asset Recovery & Remittance (INACTIVE)

Potential future workflows where external systems liquidate assets
(salvage, collateral, etc.) and return proceeds.

### Status
- ❌ Not live
- ❌ No ownership defined
- ❌ No accounting treatment defined
- ❌ No legal authority defined

### Explicitly Forbidden Until Activated
- `/remittance` endpoints
- Salvage revenue accounts
- Auction proceeds ingestion

## Phase Y — Lending & Collateral Management (INACTIVE)

### Description
Loan origination, collateral custody, and default recovery.

### Status

1. A formal spec is written
2. Ownership is defined
3. Accounting rules are locked
4. Legal review is complete
5. Versioned approval is recorded
